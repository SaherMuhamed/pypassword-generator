# PyPassword Generator
This Python script, "Password Generator Project", is a simple command-line tool that allows you to generate strong and secure passwords with custom requirements. It utilizes Python's random module to randomly select characters from different sets, such as letters, numbers, and symbols, to create a unique password.

## How to Use
1. The script will prompt you to enter the desired characteristics of your password:
   - The number of `letters` you want in your password.
   - The number of `symbols` you want in your password.
   - The number of `numbers` you want in your password.
2. After providing the inputs, the script will generate a strong password and display it on the screen.

## Example Usage
- Here's an example of how the script works:
```text
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!

How many letters would you like in your password? 8
How many symbols would you like? 4
How many numbers would you like? 2

Your password is: aT$%bF(8)3gY2
```
- Keep in mind that each time you run the script, a new password will be generated based on your inputs.

## Customization
- You can customize the character sets used to generate passwords by modifying the letters, numbers, and symbols lists in the script. Feel free to add or remove characters according to your security requirements.<br><br>
